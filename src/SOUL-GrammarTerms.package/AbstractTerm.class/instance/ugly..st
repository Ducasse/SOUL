code tagging
ugly: message
	"Used to tag code with annotations about how ugly it is. Implemented here because it is used in the keyworded syntax extension but does not actually seem to exist (When I developed the keyworded syntax I could use that message but it does not seem to be part of the base visualworks packages, I'm guessing it came from the StarBrowser or something"
