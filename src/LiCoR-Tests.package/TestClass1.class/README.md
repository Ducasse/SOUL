It is important for the tests that TestClass1 declares the following instance variables:
	array	<SequenceableCollection>
	iv1		<ArithmeticValue | CPointer>
	iv2		<Object>
and that its meta class declares the following instance variables:
	mcivar1	<Object>
Do not change (i.e. remove or rename) any of these variables!
